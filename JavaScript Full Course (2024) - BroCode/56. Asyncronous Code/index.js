                  Code that waits for an operation to complete

    Asynchronous - Allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently without waiting
                   Doesn't block the execution flow and allows the program to continue
                   (I/O operations, network requests, fetching data)
                   Handled with: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await
